        <p class="date">January 1, 2024         everyone has greed, and i feel like it will be the death of us all, we all
        have something we have greed for, examples in history show this very clearly,
        rulers would conquer land because they want more power, and in the procces many
        people die, many civilizations die, and many cultures die, and we are getting
        to the point where people are greedy over the natural recouces, like land(still),
        and who uses what, who uses the space to fuel the ai data centers, who uses the
        fuel to destroy natural habibtas, and so on, but we will get to the point where
        we cant do anything to stop it, we have to "trust" the politiicans to do something
        right, but even then, all they care about is there personal gain, and thats really
        messed up(duh). so the world will spiral into a deep depresion were the human
        species will die out because of our stupid mistakes and we are slowly getting there.</p>
