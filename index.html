      <h3>
        i remeber my older brother telling me this, i remeber seeing this on tv, but just because i see it doesnt
        mean i agree with it, i hate this statement, i have cried many times, many times in public, many times in private, 
        humans have emotoions, we cant  bottle up our emotions just because of a statement like this, we have to talk
        about things, we need someone to talk to and we need someone to cry to
