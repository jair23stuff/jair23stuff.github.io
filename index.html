      <h2>greed</h2>
      <h3>everyone has greed, and i feel like it will be the death of us all, we all have something we have greed for, examples in history show this very clearly, rulers would conquer land because they want more power, and in the procces many people die, many civilizations die, and many cultures die, and we are getting to the point where people are greedy over the natural recouces, like land(still), and who uses what, who uses the space to fuel the ai data centers, who uses the fuel to destroy natural habibtas, and so on, but we will get to the point where we cant do anything to stop it, we have to "trust" the politiicans to do something right, but even then, all they care about is there personal gain, and thats really messed up(duh). so the world will spiral into a deep depresion were the human species will die out because of our stupid mistakes and we are slowly getting there. </h3>
